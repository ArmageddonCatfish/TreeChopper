TODO
Add multithreading to let bot launched window stay responding

Add wrapper to export as .exe

RESOLVED
Add another window after launching that shows the bot's status
    public updateStatus() method in gui class called at various points by the bot
    just to make the bot more understandable to end user
    works but stops responding, need to implement more multithreading
Make non-hook position correction more accurate
    Walk until no longer "at root", walk some more, swing until broken
    Adjusted and is now satisfactory
Make work without torches
    Toggle smart select in between swings when you dont have any
    Nah you just straight up need at least one torch in ur inventory at all times to properly deselect the axe after chopping
Add keybinds to GUI
    Need binds for forward, back, jump, smart cursor, autoselect, and grapple
    largely unnecessary and technically demanding, just have client do these bindings beforehand
